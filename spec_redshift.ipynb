    "The code below is to be used for semi-automatically identifying emission features in a given spectra by taking advantage of the fact that while the locations of lines change with redshift, the ratios between line positions are redshift-invariant. The ratios of all possible line pairs in an input calibration list are compared  with the ratios of all possible pairs of observed liness, and matches are suggested if a pair of observed wavelengths has a ratio within a user-specified error of a calibration pair. The suggested identifications for these pairs are then printed out, and their redshifts (and averaged redshfit estimate with uncertainty) can also be printed out if desired. Any additions, changes, or improvements to the code below are more than welcome!\n",

    "Here we see other possibilites arise, but seeing as the line pair with lines 3 & 4 is doubly identified, and that the first two redshift values are not at all consistent with the others, we can say with confidence that these identifications are not correct. We may tighten our sample by forcing a redshift range between z_high and/or z_low, but note here that the discrepant lines were automatically exluded by the default redshift clipping radius of 0.1 (this can be altered with the clip parameter)."
